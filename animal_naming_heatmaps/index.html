Using the SBU 1-Million image-caption dataset we have calculated the level at which each animal concept is named. The results are provided as heat-maps for the animal classes: mammals, birds and reptiles.</br></br>
<a href="heat_map_mammals.html">Mammalia (mammals)</a></br>
<a href="heat_map_birds.html">Aves (birds)</a></br>
<a href="heat_map_reptiles.html">Reptilia (reptiles)</a></br></br>
The level of name used to describe different animals. The first row is the most general level, and the last is the most specific. Each column is a different animal corresponding to a visual classifier. Darker colours indicate larger counts; with columns normalised. Each column must have at least 20 detections to be included. The hover-text shows the names which where matched to the animal and level. Name frequencies are also provided in the hover-text.
